## üì± AI-Powered Tongue Analysis for Holistic Health

HealthLingua is a cutting-edge mobile application that leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning to analyze your tongue and provide insights into your holistic health. Built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, this app brings traditional Eastern medical diagnostic methods into the digital age.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Image Capture**: Take a photo of your tongue using your device camera
- **Gallery Import**: Select existing tongue images from your gallery
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant AI-powered analysis of your tongue features
- **Health Scoring**: Receive personalized Nutrition and Mantle scores

### Tongue Analysis Parameters
The app extracts five key features from your tongue image, each scored on a scale of 0-10:

1. **Coated Tongue**: Measures the amount of white or yellowish coating
2. **Jagged Tongue Shape**: Evaluates the degree of serrated or uneven edges
3. **Cracks on the Tongue**: Analyzes the number and depth of fissures
4. **Size of Filiform Papillae**: Measures the fine hair-like projections on tongue surface
5. **Redness of Fungiform Papillae**: Evaluates the color intensity of the red, round papillae

### Health Scores
Based on the extracted features, the app calculates:
- **Nutrition Score**: Indicates nutritional balance and potential dietary needs
- **Mantle Score**: Reflects internal energy and overall health state

## üì≤ Installation

### Requirements
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher
- Camera permission
- Storage permission for gallery access

### Direct Installation
1. Clone and Build the App

### Server Setup (For Developers)
